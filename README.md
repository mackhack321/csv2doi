# csv2doi

CSV2DOI is a part of my work as a web development student assitant for Mississippi State University Libraries. CSV2DOI is a tool that was used by the Office of Thesis and Dissertation Format Review for batch-registering DOIs (Digital Object Identifier) for graduate and honors theses and dissertations. Bulk DOI information was uploaded into CSV2DOI in a CSV file, and the file was passed to the Flask backend which parsed the CSV file and generated an XML file that met the formatting requirements of Crossref, a DOI registration agency. This XML file could then be uploaded ito Crossref's web portal and the new DOIs would be created. The project has since been sunset, but I have preserved it for demonstration purposes.
